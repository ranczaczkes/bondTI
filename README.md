When I began writing the assignment i had hard time choosing between using a micro service as Flask or trying and writing it 
using only simple tools. In the end I wrote both.
So server file is a simple http file using BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer 
and flask_server is using Flask.
Succesful flights is the class that can genarte the succes column and if you wish there is a GET method on the flask the will generate
a file with the data.
